The goal of this github is to have a central location to store
repositories of code used by the STScI MIRI team as part of
carrying out their functional MIRI related duties.

Having a central location for such code provides for long-term
curation of the code.  In addition it encourages more efficent development
of code by taking advantage of the expertise of multiple team members.

on effective use of this space, git/github, and
distributed team-based code development.
